# Overview

This e-commerce application leverages React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, connected to a MongoDB database. Using Docker, each component (frontend, backend, MongoDB) is containerized with Dockerfiles and orchestrated with docker-compose. After building the Docker images, they are pushed to Docker Hub for deployment. This approach ensures consistency across development and production environments, facilitates easy scaling, and simplifies deployment management using containerization technologies.
