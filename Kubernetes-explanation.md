# Microservice Orchestration with Kubernetes (Yolo)
## Deployment Explanation
## Overview

This document explains the process of deploying an application from a local Minikube environment to Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The application consists of a backend service connected to a MongoDB database and a frontend service.

## Prerequisites
- Google Cloud Account: Ensure you have an active Google Cloud account if not signin or signup.
- Billing Enabled: Billing must be enabled on your Google Cloud project.
- Google Cloud SDK: Installed and configured on your local machine.
- Kubectl: Installed and configured on your local machine.
- Minikube: Installed and running on your local machine.

### Installing Minikube
 For Linux users

     curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
     sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

To confirm if minikube is installed succesfully, run the following command

     minikube version

Expected output

     minikube version: v1.33.1

To Start Minikube

     minikube start

Check if minikube is running

     minikube status

### Installing Kubectl
Run this command
     
     sudo snap install kubectl --classic

Once all this is set up navigate to your working directory in my case I will navigate to `/home/kevin/devops/IP2/yolo`.

Create directory
    
    mkdir manifests

 Then add the below files inside: 

Create three files

 - `touch backend-deployment.yaml`
 - `touch frontend-deployment.yaml`
 - `touch mongodb-deployment.yaml`


Update the files with the deployment content including the service for you to be able to access it over the internet

Execute the below comands

    kubectl apply -f backend-deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f mongodb-deployment.yaml

This will create `pods`

    - To view if pods and services have been created execute the below command.
- `kubectl get pods`
- `kubectl get services`

    - Incase of an Error run the below command with the deployment name. This will show `logs` or show more infomation about the `pod` created
- `kubectl logs`
- `kubectl describe`

    -   Example
- `kubectl logs frontend-deployment`

### Download and Install Google Cloud SDK

    - Update and Install Dependencies
- `sudo apt-get update`
- `sudo apt-get install -y curl python3`

    - Download the Google Cloud SDK
- `curl -O https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-sdk-488.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`

    - Extract the Archive
- `tar -xf google-cloud-sdk-488.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`

    - Run the Installation Script
- `./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh`
    - You will be prompted to modify your profile to include the Cloud SDK path. Confirm the prompts to update your profile.

    - Initialize the SDK
- `./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud init`

### Configure Google Cloud SDK

1. Log In to Your Google Cloud Account

- `gcloud auth login`    
    - Follow the instructions to log in to your Google account via the web browser.

2. Set the Default Project

- `gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]`
     - Replace [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with the ID of your Google Cloud project.
     Example: `gcloud config set project kevin-yolo`

3. Set the Default Compute Region and Zone
- `gcloud config set compute/region [YOUR_REGION]`
- `gcloud config set compute/zone [YOUR_ZONE]`
    - Replace [YOUR_REGION] and [YOUR_ZONE] with your preferred region and zone, respectively.

### Verify Installation

    - To verify that the installation and configuration were successful, you can run:
- `gcloud --version`

    -   To provides detailed information about your gcloud configuration, including the current project and active account.
- `gcloud info`  

## Steps to Deploy 

### Prepare the Environment
1. Log in to Google Cloud
- `gcloud auth login`

2. Set the Project
- `gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]`
    -   Example in my case - `gcloud config set project kevin-yolo`

3. Enable Required APIs
- `gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com`

### Create a Kubernetes Cluster
1. Create the Cluster
- `gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE] --num-nodes=3`
    - Example - `gcloud container clusters create my-cluster --zone us-central1-c --num-nodes=3`

2. Get Cluster Credentials
- `gcloud container clusters get-credentials [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE]`
    - Example - `gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster --zone us-central1-c`

### Deploy the Application
1. Apply Kubernetes Manifests
    - Ensure your manifest files (YAML) are correctly set up. These files should define deployments, services,statefulsets and any other required Kubernetes resources.
    
- `kubectl apply -f mongodb-deployment.yaml`
- `kubectl apply -f backend-deployment.yaml`
- `kubectl apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml`

    - This will deploy the application:
        - MongoDB StatefulSet: For database persistence.
        - Backend Deployment: The backend service connected to MongoDB.
        - Frontend Deployment: The frontend service exposing port 3000.

### Verify Deployment
1. Check Pods
    - Verify that all pods are running correctly:
    - `kubectl get pods`

!["check pods"](/images/check-pods.png)

2. Check Services
    - Ensure that the services are created and exposed correctly:
- `kubectl get services`

!["check services"](/images/check-services.png)

3. Check nodes
    - Check and verify 3 nodes are there.
- `kubectl get nodes`

!["check nodes"](/images/get-nodes.png)

### Accessing the Application

    - We access the frontend service using the external IP and port provided by the service.

    - http://34.170.199.139:3000/


### YOLO External Link

1. [Frontend application Endpoint/External IP ](http://34.170.199.139:3000/)

#### Application Page from the External IP
1. Application Homepage

!["Web Application from External_IP](/images/YoloMy-extIP.png)


### Troubleshooting
1. Pods Not Running
    - If a pod is not running or is in a CrashLoopBackOff state, check logs:
- `kubectl logs [POD_NAME]`

    - Inspect the pod description for detailed error information:
- `kubectl describe pod [POD_NAME]`

## Conclusion

Following these steps, you should have successfully deployed your application from a local Minikube environment to Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine. This setup provides scalability and management benefits by leveraging Google Cloudâ€™s Kubernetes infrastructure.
